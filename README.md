#Dataset Cleaning
This repository contains scripts and guidelines for cleaning a dataset using Python, focusing on removing missing values and outliers from the provided train.csv and test.csv files.

#Files
train.csv: This file contains the training dataset.
test.csv: This file contains the testing dataset.
gender_submission.csv: This file is not directly used for cleaning but might be relevant for your analysis or modeling.
#Requirements
Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
seaborn (optional, for visualization)
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn
Steps to Clean the Dataset
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataset-cleaning.git
cd dataset-cleaning
2. Prepare the Environment
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Cleaning Script
Execute the Python script clean_dataset.py to clean the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python clean_dataset.py
This script will perform the following actions:

Load the train.csv and test.csv datasets.
Identify and handle missing values by either removing or imputing them.
Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods.
Save the cleaned datasets as cleaned_train.csv and cleaned_test.csv.
4. Review Cleaned Datasets
After running the script, you will find the cleaned datasets (cleaned_train.csv and cleaned_test.csv) in the same directory.

#Additional Notes
You can modify the cleaning process by editing the clean_dataset.py script according to your specific requirements.
Feel free to customize the cleaning process further, such as adding more outlier detection techniques or specific handling for different types of missing values.
